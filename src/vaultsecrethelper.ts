    //    no matter what you specified for clientid. If you specified an incorrect managed identity, that error is swallowed.
    // 2) If system assigned identity does not have permission to keyvault, and the id you specified has permission, 
    //    you will get the secret using the id you specified
    // 3) if system assigned identity does not have permission to keyvault, and the id you specified is wrong or does not 
    //    have permission to keyvault, the error thrown only shows that the system assigned identity does not have permission. no mention is made about the id you provided.
